// rule, a rule carries its own ExpirationInDays, and a rule cannot read a
// number out of a DynamoDB item — so the only thing an upload can vary per user
// is WHICH rule matches, by way of an object tag. One rule per tier is
// therefore one tier per rule, and the set has to be small enough to write down
// in the template.

// honoured no later than requested — it is a promise to delete, and rounding it
// up would break that promise silently. A value shorter than the shortest tier
// is the one exception: there is nothing briefer to offer, so it becomes the
